# Arduino
C++ code for Smart Stick based on Arduino.

I along with my team came up with an idea of making Smart multi functional blind stick for visually impaired people
to help them do their daily activities with ease. Stick had many features like obstacle detection, locating stick using remote, etc.
Stick was made from lightweight PVC pipe and all sensors from infrared to water detector along with vibration motors were connected
using wires to the aurdino board(inside a cardboard box) which was in the middle of the stick with other sensors.
